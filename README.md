Bolt.talk: Bolt.new + Voice

## forked from https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm

1. Rename .env.example to .env.local and add your LLM API keys. You will find this file on a Mac at "[your name]/bold.new-any-llm/.env.example". 

Get your Open AI API Key by following these instructions: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
```

Optionally, you can set the debug level:

```
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in .gitignore.

## Run Without Docker

1. Install dependencies using Terminal (or CMD in Windows with admin permissions):

```
pnpm install
```

2. Start the application with the command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```


## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `pnpm run build`: Builds the project.
- `pnpm run start`: Runs the built application locally using Wrangler Pages. This script uses `bindings.sh` to set up necessary bindings so you don't have to duplicate environment variables.
- `pnpm run preview`: Builds the project and then starts it locally, useful for testing the production build. Note, HTTP streaming currently doesn't work as expected with `wrangler pages dev`.
- `pnpm test`: Runs the test suite using Vitest.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript type checking.
- `pnpm run typegen`: Generates TypeScript types using Wrangler.
- `pnpm run deploy`: Builds the project and deploys it to Cloudflare Pages.

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the Remix Vite development server. You will need Google Chrome Canary to run this locally if you use Chrome! It's an easy install and a good browser for web development anyway.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips to get the most out of Bolt.new:

- **Be specific about your stack**: If you want to use specific frameworks or libraries (like Astro, Tailwind, ShadCN, or any other popular JavaScript framework), mention them in your initial prompt to ensure Bolt scaffolds the project accordingly.

- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Before sending your prompt, try clicking the 'enhance' icon to have the AI model help you refine your prompt, then edit the results before submitting.

- **Scaffold the basics first, then add features**: Make sure the basic structure of your application is in place before diving into more advanced functionality. This helps Bolt understand the foundation of your project and ensure everything is wired up right before building out more advanced functionality.

- **Batch simple instructions**: Save time by combining simple instructions into one message. For example, you can ask Bolt to change the color scheme, add mobile responsiveness, and restart the dev server, all in one go saving you time and reducing API credit consumption significantly.
